Questions :

In your point of view, what was complicated in the TP#2? What where your pain points? What could you do when expanding this TP to avoid these further?

In my opinion the most complicated thing in the TP2 was the part where we had to understand how API works and how can we retrieve information from the API we want. I took a lot of times to try to understand, as I could, how API works and how can I use the information efficiently. After I understood that, I tried some command line and understand it a little bit more. I don't think that I can avoid these complication because it is part of the understanding and part of the learning we have to do in order to use API correctly.

What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles? What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”? What’s clean code, clean architecture?

The S.O.L.I.D. principles are basics design principles in C# and stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open closed Principle (OSP), Liskov substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). This principle enable us to manage most of the software design problems and to move from tightly coupled code and little encapsulation to the desired results of loosely coupled and encapsulated real needs of a business properly.

The "KISS rule" is the : KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. This rule simply indicates that the simplest solution or path should be taken in a situation.

The "boy scout rule" says that : "It's not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time.". So we must take an active role in preventing the degradation of our code.

A clean code is a code where you :

- Use meaningful names
- Use convention
- Try not to produce unused code
- Pay attention to structure
- Comments and variable names in your native language
- Use project patterns
- Do not write classes with too many lines of code
- Write unit tests
- Try not to write redundant code.
- Unused Code Rule Complement
- Reuse written code
- Do not use comments to comment out unused code
- Use proper indentation, code formatting etc.
- Do not use magic numbers
- Try to avoid constructing vast methods
- Do not write a few instructions in one line.

A clean architecture has the characteristics of being :

- Independent of any framework / user interface / database
- Testable
- Well organized, i.e. nice for developers

This architecture is broken down into 4 distinct layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation. The rule is simple: only an upper layer can access the lower layer.

How would you expand this code? What can you add to the software you build to make it more useful, reliable, relevant to the user? Find 5 ways to improve your previous TP, even if that’s not doable.

Organize better my program.cs, make it less repeatable. Writting more useful comments for my code in general Using more meaningful names for my variables and functions Using more often projet patterns Write unit tests
